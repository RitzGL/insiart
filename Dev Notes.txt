TODAY'S NOTES:

COMPONENTS
	FOOTER
		This gets styled weird when a form is added. 
		Must be because of position:absolute. If cannot fix, just delete footer.

	FORM - Signup
		Form could contain: Fave Artist as a reference to recomment art to a user.
		OR
		Form could contain drop down menu with options attained from hitting the
		API, and returning available departments returned to us.
